# Pride Places

Coding Challenge for Pride Places, used to test candidates knowledge of front-end web-development.

## Lessons Learned

First project built with Nextjs and Framer-Motion. I had some practice using similar frameworks like Gatsbyjs and React-Spring.
Some of the features I enjoyed building were: The Nextjs Image Optimization and Pages.
